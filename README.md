# ValidatedForm
Hi! Thanks for checking this repo.

This assessment is a simple form validated with JavaScript on the client side. If all inputs are entered correctly,
they are stored into the local storage of the browser and the form resets. If not, the user immediately sees the error and the form isn't submitted.

This project is accomplished with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
